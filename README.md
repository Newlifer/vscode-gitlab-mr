# VS Code - Gitlab MR

VS Code extension for working with Gitlab Merge Requests, supporting both Gitlab.com and Gitlab EE/CE servers.

## Features

* Supports both Gitlab.com and Gitlab CE/EE servers.
* Configurable default remote (e.g. `origin`) and branch (e.g. `master`).

### Create MR

Create an MR from VS Code by providing a branch name and commit message.

**Workflow**

1. Open the command palette and select **Gitlab MR: Create MR**.
2. First, input the name of the branch you want created for this MR. If you are not on your default branch, the current branch name will be autofilled (providing a different branch name will result in a new branch).
3. Next, provide the commit message for the changes. If the branch is clean, the last commit message will be autofilled (providing a different commit message will only impact the MR).
4. If the new branch is different from your current branch, the new branch will be created and checked out.
5. If the current branch has uncommitted changes, all changed files will be committed with the provided commit message.
6. The branch will be pushed to the remote specified as `gitlab-mr.targetRemote` (defaults to `origin`).
7. An MR will be created to the branch specified as `gitlab-mr.targetBranch` (defaults to `master`) from the new branch.
8. A message will be shown in VS Code with a link to the MR.

### Checkout MR

Checkout out an existing MR from the current repo.

**Workflow**

1. Open the command palette and select **Gitlab MR: Checkout MR**.
2. Select an MR from the list.
3. If the branch for the selected MR does not exist on your computer, it will be created and switched to.
4. If the branch for the selected MR does exist on your computer, it will be switched to.

### View MR

View an existing MR in your browser.

**Workflow**

1. Open the command palette and select **Gitlab MR: View MR**.
2. Select an MR from the list.
